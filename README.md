# What are the aims of µLRM?

µLRM or microLRM is an open source alternative to Illumina's [Local Run Manager](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/local-run-manager.html). µLRM is a compiled software for real-time microscope and fluidics control that turns any microscope supported by micro-manager's [mmCoreAndDevices](https://github.com/micro-manager/mmCoreAndDevices) into a sequencing machine for _in situ_ sequencing.

With micro Local Run Manager you will be able to: create, monitor, & analyze microscope sequencing runs.  

## Dependencies

* [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
* [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
* [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
* [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT)
* [PolyScope](https://polyscope.run/)


## How is µLRM input and output organized?

### Output

Output format closely follows the file folder structure of most contemporary sequencing machines.

### Input

## Structure of build
``` text
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── app
│   └── main.cpp
├── include
│   ├── example.h
│   └── exampleConfig.h.in
├── src
│   └── example.cpp
└── tests
    ├── dummy.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

Additional sources go in [src/](src/), header files in [include/](include/), main programs in [app/](app), and
tests go in [tests/](tests/) (compiled to `unit_tests` by default). 

If you add a new executable, say `app/hello.cpp`, you only need to add the following two lines to [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt): 

``` cmake
add_executable(main app/main.cpp)   # Name of exec. and location of file.
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${LIBRARY_NAME})  # Link the executable to lib built from src/*.cpp (if it uses it).
```

You can find the example source code that builds the `main` executable in [app/main.cpp](app/main.cpp) under the `Build` section in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt). 
If the executable you made does not use the library in [src/](src), then only the first line is needed.


## Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

``` bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
> make
> ./main
> make test      # Makes and runs the tests.
> make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
> make doc       # Generate html documentation.
```
<!--
## Services

If the repository is activated with Travis-CI, then unit tests will be built and executed on each commit.
The same is true if the repository is activated with Appveyor.

If the repository is activated with Coveralls/Codecov, then deployment to Travis will also calculate code coverage and
upload this to Coveralls.io and/or Codecov.io
